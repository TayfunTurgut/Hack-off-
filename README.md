# Introduction:
A corporation hired you and some other hackers to compete in a race, to gather information from another rival corporation. You start with little information about the corp and everyone is gathering as much data as they can. The winner takes all the money while others dissapear into the shadows waiting for the next big game. Will you win the prize, or will you be one of the hackers who lurk in the deep web?
You gain data through a couple of steps, and the next player does the same, rotating in clockwise order.
- Manipulate Corporate Interface tiles and sum the values to acquire a port to access the rival corporation.
- Try to defend yourself against one other hacker who will try to sniff on some data when it is uploading to your server.
- Find out the worth of the data you acquired, some are very valuable on its own, some are very fragmented that they make sense and worth a lot once you start to acquire more of the same data.

When the last Corporate Data card is drawn, the game ends immediately. You sum up all the Corporate Data cards (including their set bonuses), the amount of Data Fragment tokens you own, and any bonuses you gained from your Hacker Identity card. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player who owns the most Data Fragment tokens win.

# Setup:
- Deal a random Hacker Identity card to each player random side face-up.
- Give each player 2 Data Fragment Tokens.
- Shuffle Corporate Interface tiles and place 9 of them on the board random face-up in a 3x3 grid. Put the rest of them to the game box, you won't be using them this game.
- Seperate all Corporate Data cards according to their values, and create 6 stacks with them containing values 1 to 6.
Notice that one of each data values contain a skull symbol, these must be seperated into different stacks for gameplay purposes.
Put them near the Corporate Interface tiles face-down side by side.
- Place the Interface Port tokens in an ascending order random side face-up on top of the Corporate Data cards.
- Seperate the malware cards with values -1 and -2 and put them near the Corporate Interface Tiles face-up.
- Place the Data Transaction tokens in ascending order near the Corporate Interface Tiles.
- Place the Interface Bridge tokens and the Data Fragment tokens near the Corporate Interface Tiles where everyone can easily reach.

You are ready to begin!

# Gameplay:
Players take turns in clockwise order, until all Corporate Data cards are depleted.
A turn consists of the following steps:
- Choose and rotate one Corporation Interface tile 90Â° clockwise.
- Choose and rotate one other Corporation Interface tile that is adjacent to the first one.
- Sum the numbers on the tiles that is facing each other. That is your Interface Port number.
- If both the numbers facing each other has a skull symbol on them, take a -2 malware card and shuffle it in any Corporate Data stack. If a stack is empty, you cannot put any malware in that stack.
- Put one Data Fragment token under one of the 4 Data Transaction tokens. This should be based on your predictions of the value of the Corporate Data card you will draw this turn. Note that putting a token under the skull symbol means the guess of the draw is a malware card.
- The player who is sitting on your right then also puts one Data Fragment token under one of the remaining 3 Data Transaction tokens.
- Draw the top card of the Corporate Data from the stack that is matching your Interface Port number and put it near your Hacker Identity card face-up.
- If the drawn card has a skull symbol on it, take a -1 malware card and shuffle it in any Corporate Data stack. If a stack is empty, you cannot put any malware in that stack.
- Resolve the transaction:
  - If your guess of the Corporate Data card value was right, take both Data Fragment tokens and add them to your pile.
  - If neither player guessed right, the tokens go to the pile next to the Corporate Interface tiles.
  - If your opponent guessed right, then he takes both Data Fragment tokens and add them to his pile.
  - If any of the players guess a malware and win, they take one additional Data Fragment token from the other player.
