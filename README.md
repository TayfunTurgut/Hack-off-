- 6  Hacker Identities
- 21 Interface cards
- 36 Data cards
- 12 Malwares

- 8  Data Depletion cards
- 4  Interface Bridges

# Introduction:
A corporation hired you and some other hackers to compete in a race, which the object is to gather information from another rival corporation. You start with little information about the corp and everyone else is gathering as much data as they can. The winner takes all the money while others dissapear into the shadows waiting for the next big game. Will you win the prize, or will you be one of the hackers who lurk in the deep web?

In Hack-off!, you gain Data through a couple of steps, then the next player does the same, rotating in clockwise order.
- Manipulate Interface cards and add their values together to acquire a Port number to access the rival corporation.
- Try to defend yourself against one other hacker who will try to sniff on some Data when it is in Transaction.
- Find out the worth of the Data you acquired, some are very valuable on its own, and some are very fragmented that they make sense and worth a lot once you start to acquire more of the same.

When the last Data card is drawn, the game ends immediately. You sum up all the Data cards you collected (including their set bonuses), the amount of Fragment tokens you own, and any bonuses you gained from your Identity card. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player who owns the most Fragment tokens wins.

# Setup:
- Deal a random Identity to each player. They choose which side of the Identity to play with.
- Give each player 5 Data Fragments.
- Place 9 Interface cards on the board in a 3x3 grid. Put the rest of them to the game box, you won't be using them this game.
- Take 6 Data Depletion cards randomly and place them near the Interface cards side by side. Put the rest of them to the game box, you     won't be using them this game.
- Place the Interface Ports in an ascending order on the appropriate spaces of the Data Depletion cards.
- Seperate all Data cards according to their values, and create 6 stacks face-down with them containing values from 1 to 6.
  Notice that one of each data values contain a skull symbol, these must be put into 6 different stacks for gameplay purposes.
- Put the Data cards under the Interface Ports.
- Seperate the Malwares with values -1 and -2 and put them near the Interface cards face-up.
- Place the Transaction Trackers in ascending order near the Interface Tiles.
- Place the Interface Bridges and Data Fragments near the Interface Tiles.

You are ready to begin!

# Gameplay:
Players take turns in clockwise order, until all Data cards are depleted.
A turn consists of the following steps:
- Choose and rotate one Interface card 90° clockwise.
- Choose and rotate one other Interface card 90° clockwise that is adjacent to the first one.
- Sum the numbers on the cards you rotated that are facing each other. That is your Interface Port number.
- If both numbers facing each other has a skull symbol on them, take a -2 Malware card and shuffle it in any Data card stack. If a stack is empty, you cannot put any Malware in that stack.
- Put one Fragment card on the appropriate place of one of the four Transaction Trackers. This should be based on your predictions of the value of the Data card you will draw this turn. Note that putting a token under the skull symbol means your guess of the draw is a Malware.
- The player who is sitting on your right then also puts one Fragment card on one of the remaining three Transaction Trackers.
- Draw the top card of the stack that is matching your Interface Port number and put it near your Identity card face-up. It is important to store each pile of cards with different values seperately and side by side for clarity.
- If the drawn card has a skull symbol on it, take a -1 Malware card and shuffle it in any Data card stack. If a stack is empty, you cannot put any malware in that stack.
- Resolve the Transaction:
  - If your guess of the Data card value was right, take both Fragments and add them to your pile.
  - If neither player guessed right, the cards go to their pile next to the Interface cards.
  - If your opponent guessed right, then he takes both Fragments and adds them to his pile.
  - If any of the players guess a Malware and win, they take one Fragment from the other player in addition to the Data Fragments under the Transaction Trackers.
