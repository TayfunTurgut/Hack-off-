# Introduction:
A corporation hired you and some other hackers to compete in a race, to gather information from another rival corporation. Everyone is gathering as much data as they can, and the winner takes all the money while others dissapear into the shadows waiting for the next big game. Will you win the prize, or will you be one of the hackers who lurk in the shadows?
You gain data through a couple of steps, and the next player does the same, rotating in clockwise order.
- Manipulate Corporate Interface tiles and sum the values to acquire a port to access the rival corporation.
- Try to defend yourself against one other hacker who will try to sniff on some data when it is uploading to your server.
- Find out the worth of the data you acquired, some are very valuable on its own, some are very fragmented that they make sense and worth a lot once you start to acquire more of the same data.

When the last Corporate Data card is drawn, the game ends immediately. You sum up all the Corporate Data cards (including their set bonuses), the amount of Data Fragment tokens you own, and any bonuses you gained from your Hacker Identity card. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player who owns the least Data Fragment tokens win.

# Setup:
- Deal a random Hacker Identity card to each player random face-up.
- Shuffle Corporate Interface tiles and place 9 of them on the board random face-up in a 3x3 grid. Put the rest of them to the game box, you won't be using them this game.
- Seperate all Corporate Data cards according to their values, and create 6 stacks with them containing values 1 to 6.
Notice that one of each data values contain a skull symbol, these must be seperated into different stacks for gameplay purposes.
Put them near the Corporate Interface tiles face-down side by side.
- Place the Interface Port tokens in an ascending order random side face-up on top of the Corporate Data cards.
- Seperate the malware cards with values -1 and -2 and put them near the Corporate Interface Tiles.
- Place the Data Transaction tokens in ascending order near the Corporate Interface Tiles.
- Place the Interface Bridge tokens and the Data Fragment tokens near the Corporate Interface Tiles.

You are ready to begin!
